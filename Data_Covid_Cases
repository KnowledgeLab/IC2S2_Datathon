# About Data

The Covide Cases Data is provided by NewYorkerTime.
It contains the daily cumulative number of cases and deaths reported in each county and state across the U.S. since the beginning of the pandemic.
It also includes the additional data sets: 
- Prisons: Cases in prisons
- Colleges: Cases on college and university campuses.
- Excess deaths: The elevated overall number of deaths during the pandemic.
- Mask use: A July 2020 survey of how regularly people in each county wore masks.
- Averages and anomalies: A set of pre-computed rolling averages of cases and deaths for ease of analysis or use in making graphics, along with a set of days with anomalous data that have been excluded from the averages.
