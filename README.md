# IC2S2_Datathon

Hi, Paticipants of #2022-IC2S2-Datathon,

Welcome to the Data Repo of 8th IC2S2,2022!

We provide the following datasets for you to explore. some datasets are privite, you can only download the data on game day.


## 1.Meta Business Data:
### About Data
The goal of the Business Activity Trends project is to provide humanitarian organizations and researchers with dataabout business recovery from disruptive events all over the world.  As noted above, our development of BusinessActivity Trends was inspired by the work of Eyre, De Luca, and Simini(referred to as EDS from here on out). Theseauthors propose and validate a methodology for using business social-media activity to measure business downtime andrecovery following natural disasters. Their approach leverages aggregate posting behavior of Facebook business pages,which are instances of Facebookâ€™s Pages product that are owned and operated by businesses. They hypothesize thatposting to Facebook business pages will be affected by disruptive events (such as natural disasters) and that this changecan be leveraged as a proxy measurement of the state of business sectors.

We encourage you to look at our attached white paper for more information on the data andpotential use cases. We have provided separate files in csv formatfor the years 2020 (beginning2020-03-01), 2021, and 2022 (up to 2022-06-29). Additionally, we have created versions of the data that aggregate all businesses in a county (all_agg) and disaggregate by business verticals (verticals). We highly suggest using the verticals version asaggregating all businesses tends to miss out on a lot of heterogeneity across economicsectors.

the properties are contained in our dataset
- gadm_id: The GADM id of the polygon
- gadm_county_name:The county name (GADM level 2)
- gadm_state_name: The state name (GADM level 1)
- business_vertical: The business vertical of the aggregation.
- activity_percentage: The 7-day rolling sum of totalactivity (i.e., total posts) as a percentof the average weekly baseline average. 
- activity_quantile: The level of activity as a quantilerelative to the baseline period. 
- lat: The latitude of the center of the polygon
- lon:The longitude of the center of the polygon
- ds:The date of the activity provided in YYYY-MM-DDformat defined by Pacific Time
